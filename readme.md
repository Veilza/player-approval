Character Approval adds a straightforward way for your characters to judge one another's actions during a game session.

## How It Works
Submissions appear live in a small UI for all players to see, which automatically closes after 1 minute. Other players can throw their opinions in as well during this time, with an additional option to "Abstain," and the results are posted to the chat afterwards.

## Default Keybindings
- Shift + 1: Approve
- Shift + 2: Disapprove
- Shift + 3: Abstain
